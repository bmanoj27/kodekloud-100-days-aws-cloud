The Nautilus DevOps team is tasked with deploying a containerized application using Amazon's container services. They need to create a private Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) to store their Docker images and use Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) to deploy the application. The process involves building a Docker image from a given Dockerfile, pushing it to the ECR, and then setting up an ECS cluster to run the application.

    Create a Private ECR Repository:
        Create a private ECR repository named nautilus-ecr to store Docker images.

    Build and Push Docker Image:
        Use the Dockerfile located at /root/pyapp on the aws-client host.
        Build a Docker image using this Dockerfile.
        Tag the image with latest tag.
        Push the Docker image to the nautilus-ecr repository.

    Create and Configure ECS cluster:
        Create an ECS cluster named nautilus-cluster using the Fargate launch type.

    Create an ECS Task Definition:
        Define a task named nautilus-taskdefinition using the Docker image from the nautilus-ecr ECR repository.
        Specify necessary CPU and memory resources.

    Deploy the Application Using ECS Service:
        Create a service named nautilus-service on the nautilus-cluster to run the task.
        Ensure the service runs at least one task.
