Take a Snapshot: Take a snapshot of the datacenter-rds RDS instance and name it datacenter-snapshot (please wait datacenter-rds instance to be in available state).

Restore the Snapshot: Restore the snapshot to a new RDS instance named datacenter-snapshot-restore.

Configure the New RDS Instance: Ensure that the new RDS instance has a class of db.t3.micro.

Verify the New RDS Instance: The new RDS instance must be in the Available state upon completion of the restoration process.
